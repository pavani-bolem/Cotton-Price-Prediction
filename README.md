--> Project description:
This project presents a machine learning approach to 
predicting cotton prices using a Random Forest Regressor. By 
analyzing historical data, including geographical and market 
variables, the model delivers accurate price forecasts that 
support better decision-making in the agricultural sector. The 
application of this model can help farmers, traders, and 
policymakers anticipate market trends and optimize their 
strategies. This work highlights the growing role of data
driven solutions in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability 
of agricultural economics.
